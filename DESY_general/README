Update_files.pl <hostName> 
  updates the relevant files (Files.lis) on hostName, 
  used for a single host or from DoAll.pl 

DoAll.pl 
  invokes Update_files.pl for all hosts in
    /afs/desy.de/group/hasylab/Tango/HostLists/SardanaHosts.lis

Files.lis
  contains the files to be updated, used by Update_files.pl

Files.db
  contains info about the update state of each file, used by Updata_files.pl

After files have been pushed to the remote repo, ask Hannes to 
build a new package and distribute it.
